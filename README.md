This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Expo's `useFonts` hook. The bug manifests when the hook's result is not used within the component's JSX. This leads to font loading problems without triggering any error messages, making debugging difficult. The solution involves ensuring that the `fonts` object returned by `useFonts` is used, even if only implicitly, to trigger the font loading process.
