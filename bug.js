This error occurs when using the Expo Web API, specifically the `useFonts` hook, within a functional component that doesn't directly render the result of `useFonts`.  If the component doesn't utilize the `fonts` object returned by `useFonts`, the fonts might not load, and this silent failure can be very hard to debug.  There's no immediate error message; the app just doesn't render correctly.
